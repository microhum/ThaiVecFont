### Font Dataset
- **[Preprocessed Dataset (THA)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-JuWkDZprqp-TzTwx3xf33nKccI-prpp/view?usp=sharing)**
- **[TTF Fonts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UigG2bWRfAv2VelN8uwjw6FQMteXtLv5/view?usp=sharing)**

These Thai Fonts dataset are collected by ThaiFaces from many sources like Google Fonts, F0nt.com, Fontcraft.com, etc., and other individual personal designers. Many fonts have a non-commercial license.

My work is for educational purposes. You can ONLY use this dataset for non-commercial purposes and CANNOT use this dataset and pretrained model for any commercial purposes. Using this dataset for commercial purposes may violate the principles of intellectual property.

### Blog
You can read about this work here in this blog, where I explained about my project progression.
